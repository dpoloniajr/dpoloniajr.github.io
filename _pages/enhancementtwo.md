## Bid ID Search Structure Enhancement

The artifact select for the enhancement in the algorithms and data structures category is the Hash Table C++ file for the Bid ID Search Structure assignment in the Data Structures and Algorithms course (CS260). The artifact was originally created in December 2020, consisting of data from CSV files, two C++ files, a C++ header file, and a selection of debug files. The purpose of the assignment was to explore hashing algorithms by implementing a hash with chaining of collisions for bids loaded from a CSV file. Once the C++ project was created and the appropriate compiler was chosen, the storage structure needed to be defined. The options were between an array or a vector for the storage.

### Course Outcomes Demonstrated

### Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by:

1.	Implementing UX design and communication tailored to the audience.
2.	Developing code for collaboration, maintenance, and continuous improvement.
3.	Using the interface to encourage stakeholder engagement for expedited error handling.

### Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)by:

1.	Load balancing and complexity management of algorithms through a Distributed Hash Table.
2.	Data integrity and adherence to industry security standards by transitioning to a DHT.
3.	Computing a hash table to a DHT for evaluating latency vs decentralization.

Original and enhanced technical files can be found in the course repository [CS260 Algorithm and Data Structures]([[https://github.com/dpoloniajr/CS-320-Software-Testing-Automation-and-QA]).
