In the final phase of the Computer Science program, the capstone consists of creating an ePortfolio, showcasing my growth, skills, and knowledge throughout the program. I will refine the previously submitted artifacts, integrate them into the ePortfolio, and provide reflective narratives to illuminate my journey. In the software engineering profession, a comprehensive portfolio is often the determinant of oneâ€™s expertise and uniqueness. My portfolio should not only demonstrate my expertise, but it should also depict me as someone who is motivated, organized, and capable in an area that often can have a loose and chaotic environment. The ePortfolio and self-assessment I will produce in this project will demonstrate my expertise in the computer science profession and the sub-discipline of software development.

Professional Self-Assessment
------
My journey toward obtaining this degree began in 2018 as a transfer student from a local community college. I have now become a dedicated computer science student currently in my senior year at Southern New Hampshire University. I'm enthusiastic about commencing my professional development as a software engineer and becoming part of the bigger picture in the development world. As a soon-to-be computer science graduate with a focus on software development, I have gained a broad range of technical, problem-solving, and soft skills to excel in the field, resulting in an expanded understanding of secure coding practices as well as what is "under the hood" through reserve software engineering of executed software systems.

Outside of computer science, one of my passions is video games. Not just playing them, but exploring different kinds of video games and sharing my experiences as I play them. Numerous studies reflect on the educational advantages of playing video games for software developers. Dinis Carvalho shares a perfect example of the impact of video games on his engineering career. One statement he made helped me understand how details I once dismissed or recognized as minor were in reality a key indicator of that program's progress.

"Release Notes: Fortunately today we have a whole team and a style guide for this, but back when I first joined OutSystems, my team was the owner of a very specific product area. Back then we just wrote our own release notes. Thankfully I already had read so many release notes in video games and other types of software, that writing my own came naturally. Without even thinking, I was already committing code in a format that represented release notes that users would easily read and understand"
(Carvalho, D. (2021, May 31). How Video Games Impacted My Engineering Career. Outsystems.com; Outsystems. https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/video-games-impact-engineering-career/)

Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to make a meaningful impact in the fields of cybersecurity and reverse engineering. Whether it involves advancing secure development practices, pioneering new reverse engineering methodologies, conducting research, or mentoring the next generation of professionals, I'm committed to leaving a positive mark on the industry. I believe in driving change throughout my career and making a lasting contribution to the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity and reverse engineering.


Portfolio Enhancement Plan
------
This portfolio is a curated collection of my work, enhanced and refined, to not only showcase my technical proficiency but to demonstrate my continuous commitment to learning and excellence. Each project within this portfolio has been meticulously selected and enhanced to illustrate the breadth and depth of my computer science talents. Enhancements ranged from optimizing algorithms for better efficiency and incorporating advanced data structures for robust data handling to integrating modern software development practices. In selecting projects for enhancement, I prioritized those that aligned with professional standards through the following course outcomes: 

Course Outcome 1: I EmployED strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing the following enhancements in the Animal Shelter Database Enhancement:

1. Using a test instance for privacy and data protection.
2. Using a test instance and test credentials to simulate cyber attacks.
3. Using a test instance and test credentials for learning and innovation.


Course Outcome 2: I DesignED, DevelopED, and DeliverED professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing the following enhancements_________


Course Outcome 3: I DesignED and EvaluateED computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by completing the following enhancements_________


Course Outcome 4: I DemonstrateD an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the following enhancements_________


Course Outcome 5: I DevelopED a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the following enhancements in the Animal Shelter Database Enhancement:

1. Promoting secure development lifecycle practices.
2. Enforcing the principle of least privilege.
3. Facilitating test environments for security audits and penetration testing.


Following the portfolio enhancement plan introduction, I first reviewed the code and identified areas of weakness in the code as well as potential enhancement options for the artifact. Each enhancement will go into further depth on the course outcomes and the steps taken from selecting the artifact to final results, potential risks, and possibilities for future enhancements.
