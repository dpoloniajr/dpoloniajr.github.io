In the final phase of the Computer Science program, the capstone consists of creating an ePortfolio, showcasing my growth, skills, and knowledge throughout the program. I will refine the previously submitted artifacts, integrate them into the ePortfolio, and provide reflective narratives to illuminate my journey. In the software engineering profession, a comprehensive portfolio is often the determinant of oneâ€™s expertise and uniqueness. My portfolio should not only demonstrate my expertise, but it should also depict me as someone who is motivated, organized, and capable in an area that often can have a loose and chaotic environment. The ePortfolio and self-assessment I will produce in this project will demonstrate my expertise in the computer science profession and the sub-discipline of software development.

Professional Self-Assessment
------
My journey toward obtaining this degree began in 2018 as a transfer student from a local community college. I have now become a dedicated computer science student currently in my senior year at Southern New Hampshire University. I'm enthusiastic about commencing my professional development as a software engineer and becoming part of the bigger picture in the development world. As a soon-to-be computer science graduate with a focus on software development, I have gained a broad range of technical, problem-solving, and soft skills to excel in the field, resulting in an expanded understanding of secure coding practices as well as what is "under the hood" through reserve software engineering of executed software systems.
